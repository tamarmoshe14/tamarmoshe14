## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹:blush:

My name is Tamar and Iâ€™m a junior full-stack developer.
In the past Iâ€™ve held several managerial positions in the education field, but I went on a career shift after teaching myself how to code. 
I'm a fast learner:runner: and an autodidact, and Iâ€™ve already worked on real, customer-facing projects.

### Right now looking for a junior job in the relvant topics or new topics:star:


- âš¡ Fun facts:
1. If you asked me 5 years ago I'd probably tell you that a google search and a Powerpoint presentation is the strongest connection I had to coding.
2. I love:heartpulse: snowboarding and cooking (not at the same time)
3. My name is from the bible.
